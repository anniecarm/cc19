<h1>Thoughts as I read through The Web's Grain</h1> 
<h2>Annie Carmichael</h2>

<p>I didn’t get a warm nostalgic type feeling from hearing the sound of the dialup tone. For me that tone is solely associated with fax machines because I never used dialup.</p>

<h3>Apple’s website:</h3>

Artsy websites that are built to be flashy and edgy can make content hard to understand or navigate through. There is a trend of web design that seems to be “make this site as cool looking and nonfunctional as possible” and when you see that a lot it can become a goal in your mind to replicate the pseudosofisticated tone of those sites even though it is counterproductive from a ux perspective.

<h3>“Many sites will share design solutions because we’re using the same materials. The consistencies establish best practices; they are proof of design patterns that play off the needs of a common medium, and not evidence of a visual monoculture.”</h3>

This quote is particularly interesting to me because of opposing viewpoints of design teachers at The New School. My Lang design & web teachers focus on functionality and making designs with a purpose that display the information in a way that makes sense and is best suited for the user. My parsons web and design teachers focused on design and creating layouts that display information in a way that is unique and different from whatever you might conceive to be normal. This is the first parson’s design class reading that has suggested conforming to common design styles rather than creating something new and obscure even if that means the information visibility is compromised slightly. For me, I know that designing for the user, and in particular the user who is not using to so-called intuitive design, is the most important because at the end of the day you want whoever comes onto your page to understand whatever information you are trying to get across, not just to notice how cool it looks.

<h3>Responsive Design</h3>
Looking at Kasper Laigaard’s sketch for his website, it makes more sense to arrange your elements and assign them a size instead of starting with a box to fill. It made me realize that the way I do wireframes could significantly be improved if I work with this method. Then I'd be working with the webpage like Frank said instead of fighting against it to stuff my content into a system of boxes that are limiting in size.

<h3>Design how elements build up instead of break down</h3>

I’ve always heard people say you should design for mobile and then work your way up through larger displays, but I never really thought about that too much and continued building for bigger screens because that’s what I’m looking at when I’m coding. But, it makes sense to build up your site instead of breaking it down smaller and smaller because that way you’re just expanding your work until it exceeds the largest frame and its easier to expand work than take something large and keep cutting it down until it fits into a smaller bite.
