<h3>Adding to the article, why do you see value in nonlinear narratives? When do you think they are more appropriate than linear narratives?</h3>
<p>There is value in nonlinerar narratives because it can keep the reader/user interacting with your content for longer. The interactive nature will make the user want to explore more and therefore they will be more connected with your story in the end because they have spent more time with it. I think this type of storytelling has value because you can express more about your topic and include information that is related without your content feeling random because it is still sectioned off in parts. There is a more well developed structure this way without it feeling like a strict and rigid format.</p>
<h3>How does the history of hypertext/hypermedia discussed at the beginning of this semester connect to the concepts and projects discussed in this article?</h3>
<p>By using hypertext and hypermedia you are able to link different stories and pieces of your story together. It is how this type of storytelling can be done.</p>
