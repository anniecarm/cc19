<h3>What perspectives or feelings do you have on your entrance into web design as a practice? Any specific hopes, fears, or curiosities?</h3>



<p>I am excited about working in web design. I am worried about all the things I don’t know, similar to Sam. The industry is so fast-paced and you have to keep up with everything that comes out constantly if you want to be successful. I am intimidated by how much more I need to learn, but happy about that as well because I genuinely enjoy learning all about web design. I am most looking forward to learning more interactive things and using java, past teachers of mine have skipped over that section.</p>



<h3>Which issues that Sam discussed are new to you?</h3>



<p>Accessibility is one issue that I didn’t realize how little I knew about until Sam discussed it. On past projects I thought I was designing for accessibility, but I really only designed for different device sizes and writing alternative text for images. The idea of designing for color-blind users, deaf users, low-vision user, etc is new to me.</p>



<h2>Which do you feel passionate about learning more of?</h2>



<p>I am excited to learn more coding techniques. Most of what I know is in terms of websites for articles and text-based content, so I am looking forward to getting outside of that box.</p>
