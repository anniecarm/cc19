				This documentary website was put together in a really interesting way. Rather than doing a full 360 degree image of the location, it looks like they stitched together images to get the feeling of being there while also having the ability to bring up other maps and quotes on top of the images. It also creates a barrier between the reader and the site, but not in a bad way. It feels as if it is representative of the physical barriers in that area. I like the autoplay feature on the videos. By not having to click play, it feels more natural and more like a documentary than a website. The ambient noise in the background that comes and goes as well makes the site more immersive. At one point as the image was getting closer, I could hear a door open and I felt as if I was walking into that room.

					The Carbon Map

					The carbon map website is very informative and interactive. I thought that the autoplay feature at the beginning with instructions was very helpful. I've seen a lot of data visualization websites that kind of expect you to figure it out on your own, but having a tutorial made their visualization a lot easier to understand. It's cool that there are two features going at the same time so you can compare information. First is the increase or decrease in a country's size depending on the data pressed, and the other is the heatmap which allows you to see more data. For example, when looking at the US's emissions we can see that we are larger emitters than other countries because the country is inflated, and we are able to know that the emissions are up <10% because of the overlayed heatmap that shows it. Its interesting to see that most of Asia, with the exception of Singapore, is increasing their emissions by 100-1000%. Meanwhile, Europe is consistenly lowering their emissions.

					The endless horse. I just have so many questions. I immediately looked at the page source, and I am glad I did.

					This <em>Author's Note</em>, if you will, is so great. But what I love is that they event went to the length of making the title/metaname "hooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooorse" to reflect this piece of art. I wonder how long a person could scroll on this page, is it literally forever? One thing that I would have added is maybe some sound. It would be cool if the horse neighed as your scrolled.
