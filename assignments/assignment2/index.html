        	 <h2>What are the advantages and disadvantages of developing communication methods for limited audiences? This can address the use, misuse, or lack of use of written language, technology, or visual design as forms of communication.</h2>
         	<p>When you have more ways of communicating, people who are unable to communicate in standard ways will be able to be apart of conversations they might not have had access to. As Butler said, if only certain groups are able to be literate, a “literate priesthood” could develop. With various ways of communication that are inclusive to different levels of education, and mindful of different types of physical and mental disabilities, knowledge is more attainable and a literate priesthood won’t be as big of a concern.</p>
         	<p>If communication methods are only being developed for limited audiences, then problems can arise. As Michael Mcafee said, if you are creating a communication method for a small group like 50 people, you can figure out words and symbols that make communication within that group the most effective. But, everyone who is outside of that group will not be able to understand their slang and the communication does not expand past it’s limited audience.</p>

         	<h2>As so-called “digital natives”, where do you see literacy (of language, image, culture, tech, etc.) valued and/or devalued on the Web or amongst users of the Web? Are there notable advantages or disadvantages of any perceived shifts in recent years?</h2>
        	 <p>I think that literacy has always been valued on the web. In order to be apart of any conversation or be able to understand how to use the web in general, users have to be able to be literate in how the web works in general. There is a universal language of the web that digital natives are fluent in almost from birth, we have a more natural instinct in understanding technology without too much effort by being able to recognize certain structures and symbols.</p>
        	 <p>As web pages have become more uniform—with wordpress, squaresite, and wix templates to name a few— there has been a shift in the language of the web. Users need to be literate in the typical structure of web pages to function online. For example, when I see horizontal lines stacked vertically or dots stacked vertically on a page, I know to click on it because it is a symbol for a menu. I know that arrows on the sides of pages are usually hiding more information in a hidden menu or text-box. I know keyboard shortcuts that make the web move much quicker. For my generation, this knowledge feels rudimentary, but for some groups, like the older generations, it is not common knowledge and makes functioning on the web without assistance a very difficult feat. In this sense, literacy has become devalued because most designers assume that everyone knows how their sites work and while this is true for digital natives, it is not for many people around the world.</p>

         	<h2>How do you see the expanding or limiting nature of hypertext on today's Web? Do Delany's criticisms of hypertext still hold true within the modern Web and all of its growth and advancements?</h2>
        	 <p>I never really thought of hypertext as an expanding or limiting nature. I understand Delany’s idea that hypertext can be limiting because it does the research and connects the dots for you. Without hypertext, users would have to conduct more research to find connections between different works. Without this process, there are many connections that could be missed or forgotten because that step was skipped due to hyperlinks. In this day with the modern web, however, people do tend to hyperlink at such a high rate, at least in journalism where I spend most of my time online, that I don’t know if there is any significant difference between taking the extra steps to research deeper and clicking on the links present in whatever work you are looking at.</p>

         	<h2>Are there any technological or societal speculations mentioned in this conversation that have come to be realized in the 11 years since these statements were made? Any that you see as irrelevant?</h2>
         	<p>They were definitely right about the problem of misinformation. On the internet, false information runs rampant, and it seems like we have only largely started to notice the issue since Trump’s election in 2016. Before then it wasn’t as painfully obvious how quickly false news spreads and how it can lead to severe consequences, like Trump being president.</p>
         	<p>Butler mentioned, “I wonder if when computers, for instance, can be addressed verbally, can be spoken to, whether it will still be necessary for people to be able to read and write.” Well, we are in a time when people regularly talk to their devices whether it be through a phone’s speech to text or through digital assistants like Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant , Siri, Bixby, and others. There is still a need to read and write but there certainly has been a rise in dependence on technology and verbal communication with devices will only increase as technology improves.</p>

         <div>
         	<h2>Bonus: How do you practice primitive hypertext?</h2>
         	<p>Primitive hypertext is how Butler described her action of reading multiple books at once or listening to multiple audio books at once and bouncing ideas off of each other in order to come up with new ideas and combinations of information.</p>
